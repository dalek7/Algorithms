function x2D = Projection3DTo2D(x3D,k,r,c,filter)
% Computes the x 2D points applying the following projection: 
% x = KR[I|-C]X
% where x = (x,y) is the 2D-point in 2D-image plane
%       K is a camera calibration matrix
%       R is a 3x3 rotation matrix that represents the orientation of the
%       camera coordinate frame.
%       I is the identity matrix
%       C is a coordinates of the camera in the world coordiante frame. 
%       X is the 3D-point in 3D-world cordinate frame 
%
% Input:
%       - x3D is a 4x1 matrix with 3D world points.
%	  
%       - k is a 3x3 calibration matrix.
%               _           _
%              | f       px |
%          K = |     f   py |
%              |_         1 _|
%
%         where 
%              - f is the focal length,
%
%              - (px,py) are the principal point where the principal axis
%                meets the image plane.
%       
%       - r is a 3x3 rotation matrix that represents the orientation of the
%         camera coordinate frame.
%
%       - c is 1x3 or a 3x1 a coordinates of the camera in the world
%         coordiante frame.
%
%       - filter is a flag to indicate if the points that are in back of
%       the camera are shown. filter = 0 by default.
%
%  Another usage is Projection3DTo2D(x3D, p)
%	where p is the 3x4 camera matrix.
%
% Output:
%        x2D = [x ; y] a matrix with 2D image point coordinates.
%       
%        p is the camera matrix.
